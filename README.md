## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of several interactive elements and visualizations designed to offer comprehensive insights into house sales data. The key components of the dashboard include:

# Filters:-
• Date Selector: A calendar-based selector that allows users to filter the data by specific months and days.<br>
• Year Built: A slider to filter houses based on the year they were built (ranging from 1900 to 2015).<br>
• Square Footage: Sliders to filter properties based on living square footage and lot square footage.<br>

## Visualizations:

Daily Average House Price Sales: A line chart displaying the average house prices per day for a selected month. This helps in understanding daily price fluctuations.

• Map Visualization: A map highlighting different regions within King County, providing a geographical context to the house sales data. Users can see the distribution and intensity of sales in various areas.

• Distribution of House Prices: A histogram showing the frequency distribution of house prices. This helps in identifying common price ranges and outliers.

• View vs Condition Heatmap: A heatmap that compares the average, good, and very good conditions of houses based on their view quality. This provides insights into how house condition and view impact pricing.

• Distribution of Bedrooms: A histogram illustrating the frequency distribution of houses based on the number of bedrooms. This helps in understanding the most common house sizes in terms of bedroom count.
