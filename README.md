## Dashboard Overview
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring histograms, line charts, and heatmaps to visualize average house prices across regions.<br>
• Employed histograms to display the distribution of house prices within each region, providing insights into pricing variations.<br>
• Utilized line charts to illustrate trends in house prices over time, enabling users to identify temporal patterns and fluctuations.<br>
• Integrated heatmaps to visualize spatial patterns and correlations between house prices and geographic factors, facilitating deeper analysis of regional disparities and market dynamics.<br>

## Filters:-
• Date Selector: A calendar-based selector that allows users to filter the data by specific months and days.<br>
• Year Built: A slider to filter houses based on the year they were built (ranging from 1900 to 2015).<br>
• Square Footage: Sliders to filter properties based on living square footage and lot square footage.<br>

## Visualizations:

Daily Average House Price Sales: A line chart displaying the average house prices per day for a selected month. This helps in understanding daily price fluctuations.

• Map Visualization: A map highlighting different regions within King County, providing a geographical context to the house sales data. Users can see the distribution and intensity of sales in various areas.

• Distribution of House Prices: A histogram showing the frequency distribution of house prices. This helps in identifying common price ranges and outliers.

• View vs Condition Heatmap: A heatmap that compares the average, good, and very good conditions of houses based on their view quality. This provides insights into how house condition and view impact pricing.

• Distribution of Bedrooms: A histogram illustrating the frequency distribution of houses based on the number of bedrooms. This helps in understanding the most common house sizes in terms of bedroom count.

• Distribution of Bathrooms: A histogram showing the distribution of houses based on the number of bathrooms, aiding in the analysis of house features

## Project Features:
• Interactive Filters: Users can dynamically filter the data using the date selector, year built slider, and square footage sliders to focus on specific subsets of the data.<br>
• Geographical Insights: The map visualization offers a clear view of how house sales are spread across different regions in King County.<br>
• Detailed Distributions: The histograms provide a detailed look at the distribution of prices, bedrooms, and bathrooms, helping to identify trends and patterns.<br>

## Dataset
